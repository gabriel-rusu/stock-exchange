    - Country
    - Region:
        * FTSEurofirst 300 Eurozone Index
        * FTSEurofirst 300 ex-Eurozone Index

Time series interruptions are caused by: addition or removal of constituents and industry classification changes.  Index constituents are reviewed quarterly and applied at the market close of the third Friday of the month, affecting the index on the Monday morning.  ICB is reviewed at year end with some industries being discontinued.

The values provided are index values, market capitalisations and dividend yields.  There are two types of index value; capital return and total return.  Capital return represents the performance of the price of the assets held while total return reinvests the income from constituents dividends paid into the index portfolio.

Calculations:
=============
    Index value =  market capitalisation / divisor
    Divisor = Previous Day Adj Market capitalisation / Prev day index value
    Market capitalisation = sum of price * shares * free float in specified currency for current constituents
    Previous Day Adj Market capitalisation = sum of previous price * current day shares * current free float * corporate action adjustment factor for current constituents
    Total return index = previous day total return value * current index value / (previous index value - xd adjustment)
    XD adjustment (Ex-dividend adjustment) = Value of dividends paid / divisor
